# HEALTHIER CARAMEL SQUARES

## INGREDIENTS

- FOR THE SHORTBREAD BASE:
- 200 g ground almond
- 100 ml agave syrup
- 60 g coconut oil
- FOR THE CARAMEL LAYER:
- 300 g pitted dates
- 150 g almond butter
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 6 tbsp water
- 250 g dark chocolate for top layer

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. INSTRUCTIONS
2. Blend your almond flour in a food processor to a fine texture
3. Add the agave and coconut oil and blend
4. Line a baking tin with baking parchment (we used a 6-7 inch tray) and spread the shortbread ingredients in, patting it down to compact it so that its firm and will hold its shape when cut.
5. Leave in freezer while you make the caramel to set the base
6. In a food processor blend together your caramel ingredients until smooth. Give it plenty of time to ensure that you get a super smooth caramel. Depending on your food processor this will take between 3-8 mins.
7. Spread this mixture on top of the shortbread in a smooth layer
8. Melt your dark chocolate and spread over the caramel layer.
9. Put in the freezer to set and chocolate to harden for 15 minutes
10. TOP TIP to cut these and ensure they hold their shape is to heat the blade of your knife by holding it over a kettle that has just boiled, (be careful!) allow the steam to heat up the blade. Dry the blade and then it should cut through these beautifully! Cut into squares and DEMOLISH!!!
11. These are best served from the fridge to ensure that they hold their shape
